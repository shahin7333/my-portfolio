                control yourself from scrolling. You already have the answer on how to focus. Your commitment to your

                <p>A mission statement is a short statement of why an organization exists, what its overall goal is,
                    identifying the goal of its operations: what kind of product or service it provides, its primary
                    customers or market, and its geographical region of operation.</p>

            <div>
                <p>A vision statement is an inspirational statement of an idealistic emotional future of a company or
                    group. Vision describes the basic human emotion that a founder intends to be experienced by the
                    people the organization interacts with, it grounds the group so it can actualize some existential
                    impact on the world.</p>

                <p>A goal statement, also called a “personal statement” or “statement of purpose,” is a written
                    description of your long-term professional objectives. They typically include specific
                    accomplishments, job titles, education, experience and skills you'd like to earn with a timeline for
                    achievement.</p>

            <h2 class="limits">Develop <br>Without Limits</h2>

            <p>Here is no limit to what code can do, but there is a limit to hardware that it runs on. With present
                processors, lets say you can do 10^9 calculations per second. With this speed, it will take
                computers
                years to execute codes to complex problems, which do not have polynomial running times.But overall a
                developer can develop any website to maintain limitions of rules.</p>

            <p>The term world community is used primarily in political and humanitarian contexts to describe an
                international aggregate of nation states of widely varying types. In most connotations, the term is used
                to convey meanings attached to consensus or inclusion of all people in all lands and their governments.
